# CustomerSatisfactionCheckMB

I have created a Flask web app that could be used by business owners to check their customer satisfaction. They could simply upload
their customer reviews into the textbox on the web app and then generate a pie chart that would display their reviews are positive,
negative, and neutral. Additionally, they could also generate a word cloud of the reviews to get an idea of what their customers think.

The reviews are processed and classified based on NLP(Natural language processing) which is a sector in AI(Artificial intelligence).
